    "\n",
    "This this task, you will make use of a pre-trained neural network to generate (`VGG19`) to generate art using an approach called **Neural Style Transfer**. The overall algorithm is quite similar to Deep Dream: we iteratively modify a **generated image** of your choice based on the neural network gradients. In Neural Style Transfer, however, we maintain two additional images:\n",
    "1. **Style image**: A different image than the generated image, but has same shape. As Neural Style Transfer runs, the generated image maintains its appearance (e.g. Miller keeps looking like Miller), but the generated image increasingly adopts the *style* of the style image. For example, if the style image is an image of a painting that has visible brush strokes, the generated image will look like it is a painting drawn with brush strokes (e.g. the photograph of Miller will start looking like a painted drawing of Miller)!\n",
    "2. **Content image:** A copy of the initial generated image that *does not change* as Neural Style Transfer runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the introduction of a content image that is distinct from the generated image is that the loss function used in Neural Style Transfer tries to balance two things:\n",
    "1. Preserve the original content of the content image (e.g. image should still look like Miller).\n",
    "2. Adopt the style of the style image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Neural Style Transfer simultaneously tries to minimize the discrepency (i.e. error) in the generated image between the content of the content image and the style of the style image. The generated image keeps changing so the content image serves as a stable reference for the target image content.\n",

    "1. Load in the VGG19 pre-trained network without the output layer.\n",
    "2. Make a `keras` \"Model\" that allows us extract activations (`netActs`) within the subset of VGG19 network layers of our choice. Neurons in these layers of the VGG19 network will \"dream\": modify the input image to amplify patterns that the cells \"want to see\" based on their learned weight patterns. \n",
    "3. Select the types of layers (e.g. conv, pooling, etc) that we want to use to run Deep Dream on to influence the input (generated) image.\n",
    "4. Pass image through the readout network model, compute the netAct values and gradient at the selected layers.\n",
    "5. Do gradient ascent where we add a proportion of the gradient from a network layer back into the generated image for some number of iterations. -->"
