        TODO:
        1. Initialize the weights and bias according to a Gaussian distribution centered
            at 0 with standard deviation of 0.01. Remember to initialize the bias in the same way.
        2. Write the main training loop where you:
            - Pass the inputs in each training epoch through the net.
            - Compute the error, loss, and accuracy (across the entire epoch).
            - Do backprop to update the weights and bias.
