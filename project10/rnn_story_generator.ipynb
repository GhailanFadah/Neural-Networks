        "**Answer 5:** The net was more and more coherent as the sequences continued.  This directly corresponds to the final loss. For example, after 100 epochs we see text about the \"chinny chin chin\" which comes directly from the corpus.  And after 50 epochs the text generated is attempting to write the entire sotry again (likely triggered by the \\n character). 5 and 25 epochs make a lot of mistakes and are likely unconfident about which characters could go next, meaning that the random choice is especially problematic.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Tips:**\n",
        "1. Minimize print-outs to ensure your network training does not get bogged down, but it is helpful to have a progress printout with every loss after every epoch.\n",
        "2. This training session will take several hours on the GPU. Before running your \"real\" training session, I would suggest doing a short 1 epoch run and then generate text to make sure there are no unexpected crashes.\n",
        "3. How long you train for is up to you. Lower final losses will result in better/more coherent generated text. A rough target is avg loss of `0.7` (or better).\n",
        "4. Likewise, hyperparameters are also up to you. A recommended default is an embedding size of `32`, `1000` GRU neurons, and the default learning rate `1e-3` (*this is a lot bigger of a corpus than The Three Little Pigs!*).\n",
        "5. The questions in the next section revolve around text generated from your RNN. You may want to print out the RNN generated text in the cell below immediately after training the net because then you can look at the output even if Colab kills your runtime due to inactivity.\n",
        "6. Please let me know if you run into Colab's limits (e.g. you are unable to use the GPU runtime after some usage, Colab throttles your training to a crawl, etc.). I will try to set your team up with another solution.\n",
        "7. You are being provided with methods (`save_wts`, `load_wts` in `RNN`) to save your network weights to a file. Make sure your training code saves the weights after every epoch of training. If you do this and your training gets interrupts after several hours, create a new RNN with the same hyperparameters as before, but in the RNN constructor set `load_wts=True`. This will restore your network's weights to what they were right before your training got cut off!"
